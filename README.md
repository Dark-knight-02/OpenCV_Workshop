# OpenCV_Workshop
This git repo consist of all the codes images and PPT of the workshop on basics of Numpy and OpenCV that me along with Somya Bansal conducted as a part of Aero Modelling Club IIT BHU on 31-01-2022.

## Hello My dear friend
May I guide through the repo??

If you are new to github and are little confused with what to do with the repo don't worry, just follow these instructions.

Here I have uploaded all the fies. To access them just click the view code button just above these text. Then all the files inside this repo will become visible to you. You can either download them or fork them.

You can directly go to the numpy revision notebook here : https://github.com/Dark-knight-02/OpenCV_Workshop/blob/54df900dff0c3a1b0d7572863e8e21fedf514b7a/Numpy_Revise.ipynb

!!Fork and clone!! What does that mean???

That are some basic git commands to get familiar with those commands check these
